    Thera-Notes is a unique note taking app designed for the therapist and their patient, with the end goal to help open the dialogue between sessions. So much can happen in one session, and it's sometimes difficult to remember it all. With Thera-Notes, you don't have to.
</p>
<p>We are here to help save your sessions.</p>
